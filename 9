Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

Step1: Open text editor, type the below program and save with extention .tcl (prog2.tcl ) # Initialize the NS-2 simulator
set ns [new Simulator]

# Use colors to differentiate the traffic
$ns color 1 Blue
$ns color 2 Red

# Open trace and NAM trace files set ntrace [open prog2.tr w]
$ns trace-all $ntrace

set namfile [open prog2.nam w]
$ns namtrace-all $namfile

# Create a global variable to count dropped packets set dropped_packets 0

# Define the recv function for the class 'Agent/Ping' Agent/Ping instproc recv {from rtt} {
$self instvar node_
puts "node [$node_ id] received ping answer from $from with round trip time $rtt ms"
}

# Finish Procedure proc Finish {} {
global ns ntrace namfile dropped_packets

# Dump all trace data and close the files
$ns flush-trace close $ntrace close $namfile

# Execute the NAM animation file exec nam prog2.nam &

# Analyze the trace file to count dropped packets
set drop_count [exec grep "^d" prog2.tr | grep "ping" | wc -l] puts "The number of packets dropped: $drop_count"

exit 0
}

# Create six nodes
for {set i 0} {$i < 6} {incr i} {
set n($i) [$ns node]
}

# Connect the nodes with duplex links for {set j 0} {$j < 5} {incr j} {
$ns duplex-link $n($j) $n([expr $j + 1]) 0.1Mb 10ms DropTail
}

# Create two ping agents and attach them to n(0) and n(5) set p0 [new Agent/Ping]
$p0 set class_ 1
$ns attach-agent $n(0) $p0

set p1 [new Agent/Ping]
$p1 set class_ 1
$ns attach-agent $n(5) $p1
$ns connect $p0 $p1

# Set queue size and monitor the queue
$ns queue-limit $n(2) $n(3) 2
$ns duplex-link-op $n(2) $n(3) queuePos 0.5

# Create congestion with TCP and CBR traffic set tcp0 [new Agent/TCP]
$tcp0 set class_ 2
$ns attach-agent $n(2) $tcp0

set sink0 [new Agent/TCPSink]
$ns attach-agent $n(4) $sink0
$ns connect $tcp0 $sink0

# Apply CBR traffic over TCP
set cbr0 [new Application/Traffic/CBR]
$cbr0 set packetSize_ 500
$cbr0 set rate_ 1Mb
$cbr0 attach-agent $tcp0

# Schedule events
$ns at 0.2 "$p0 send"
$ns at 0.4 "$p1 send"
$ns at 0.4 "$cbr0 start"
$ns at 0.8 "$p0 send"
$ns at 1.0 "$p1 send"
$ns at 1.2 "$cbr0 stop"
$ns at 1.4 "$p0 send"
$ns at 1.6 "$p1 send"
$ns at 1.8 "Finish"

# Run the simulation
$ns run

Step: Run the simulation program

[root@localhost~]# ns prog3.tcl
(Here “ns” indicates network simulator. We get the topology shown in the snapshot.)
